# Change Log for Raygun.Aspire.Hosting.Raygun

### v2.0.2
- Fixed a bug where exceptions with long message names could not be saved.

### v2.0.1
- Fixed a bug where new exception reports would be displayed as occurring 12 hours ago if they occurred after midday UTC (because of formatting dates with 12 hour time instead of 24 hour time - losing the precision for subsequent time logic).

### v2.0.0
- Added AI Error Resolution - Get AI suggestions to resolve exceptions via a locally running LLM in an Ollama container. This is an optional opt-in feature.
- Fixed a bug where exception messages containing characters that can't be used in file names wouldn't persist.

## The following initial versions used to live in [Raygun4Aspire](https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4aspire)

### v1.0.1
- Fixed a bug where on some machines the crash reports will fail to be saved locally due to the invalid "|" character being used in the file name. This character has now been replaced with "-". You may want to manually rename previously persisted crash reports as such in the "raygun-data" Docker volume.
- Fixed a bug where the date times would not be displayed in the locally running Raygun app depending on your local date time formatting options.

### v1.0.0
- Initial release - up to par with the Raygun4Net.AspNetCore package.
- When running in the local development environment, Raygun crash reports are sent to a locally running Raygun app that's fetched from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/raygunowner/raygun-aspire-portal).
- Optionally providing a Raygun application API Key allows crash reports to be sent to your Raygun cloud service account when your Aspire app is running in production.
